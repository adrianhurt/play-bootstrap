      text: |
        Now the field constructors can be parameterized to render every helper as B4 custom field or with feedback tooltips (instead of adding <code>'_custom</code> argument for every helper).
  migration: |
    Unfortunately, the new version breaks the way we usually imported field constructors. In the past we had the values <code>fieldConstructor</code> for "vertical", "inline" and "clear" versions of field constructors. However, now all of them are functions due to now we can parameterize them.

    In short, you should change the following:
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre><code>@import b4.vertical.fieldConstructor</code></pre>
    </div>
    Into this:
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre><code>@implicitFieldConstructor = @{ b4.vertical.fieldConstructor() }</code></pre>
    </div>

    And the same for B3 versions and for "inline" and "clear" field constructors as well.

  migration: |
    The __mixed forms__ now require a HTML given a `B3FieldConstructor` that you can declare it as implicit, so
    there is no need to declare the `B3FieldConstructor` and `Lang` explicitly for every helper within the mixed form.
    Then a code like:

    <div class="highlight">
    <pre><code>@b3.inline.form(routes.Application.index) { (ifc, lang) =>
      @b3.email( fooForm("email"), '_label -> "Email", 'placeholder -> "example@mail.com" )(ifc, lang)
      @b3.password( fooForm("password"), '_label -> "Password", 'placeholder -> "Password" )(ifc, lang)
      @b3.submit('class -> "btn btn-default"){ Sign in }(ifc)
    }
    </code></pre>
    </div>

    Is now simplified to:

    <div class="highlight">
    <pre><code>@b3.inline.form(routes.Application.index) { implicit ifc =>
      @b3.email( fooForm("email"), '_label -> "Email", 'placeholder -> "example@mail.com" )
      @b3.password( fooForm("password"), '_label -> "Password", 'placeholder -> "Password" )
      @b3.submit('class -> "btn btn-default"){ Sign in }
    }</code></pre>
    </div>

    It also happens with `b3.multifield`. Let\'s see how we should modify the `b3.datepicker` example that previously was:

    <div class="highlight">
    <pre><code>@(startField: play.api.data.Field, startArgs: (Symbol,Any)*)(endField: play.api.data.Field, endArgs: (Symbol,Any)*)(args: (Symbol,Any)*)(implicit fc: b3.B3FieldConstructor, lang: play.api.i18n.Lang)
    @b3.multifield( startField, endField )(args:_*) { (cfc, lang) =>
      &lt;div class="input-daterange input-group" @toHtmlArgs(b3.Args.inner(args).toMap)&gt;
        @b3.text(startField, startArgs:_*)(cfc, lang)
        &lt;span class="input-group-addon"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;
        @b3.text(endField, endArgs:_*)(cfc, lang)
      &lt;/div&gt;
    }</code></pre>
    </div>

    And now would be:

    <div class="highlight">
    <pre><code>@(startField: play.api.data.Field, startArgs: (Symbol,Any)*)(endField: play.api.data.Field, endArgs: (Symbol,Any)*)(args: (Symbol,Any)*)(implicit fc: b3.B3FieldConstructor, lang: play.api.i18n.Lang)
    @b3.multifield( startField, endField )(args:_*) { implicit cfc =>
      &lt;div class="input-daterange input-group" @toHtmlArgs(b3.Args.inner(args).toMap)&gt;
        @b3.text(startField, startArgs:_*)
        &lt;span class="input-group-addon"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;
        @b3.text(endField, endArgs:_*)
      &lt;/div&gt;
    }</code></pre>
    </div>


    In addition, the rendering of labels have been reimplemented. Now there are 3 arguments to parametrize them:

    * `_label`: the text for the label.
    * `_hideLabel`: a boolean indicating if the label must be hidden. It will be rendered into the DOM, but it will add the class `sr-only` to the label to hide it.
    * `_hiddenLabel`: a shortcut to use a hidden label instead of using `_label` and `_hideLabel`.

    Thus, you must take into account these changes for labels in __inline forms__:

    * `'_label` -> `'_hiddenLabel`
    * `'_label` with `'_showLabel` -> simply `'_label`

    And you can ommit every `'_label -> None` because it will be ignored.

    Finally, take into account now every argument with a `None` value will be ommited (see more about [Optional arguments](/docs#arguments-optional) support).

      For example:<br>`@b3.submit('class -> "btn btn-default"){ Send }` -> `@b3.submit('class -> "btn btn-default"){ Send }(fc)`

    1. `b3.horizontal.form(` -> `b3.form(` <small>(its important to add the `(` to avoid replace `formWithFC` as well)</small>
